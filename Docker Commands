It is generally recommended that you separate areas of concern by using one service per container.


Docker Commands:
----------------------
test:
docker version

To list the details of all containers, including stopped containers:
docker ps -a

docker images ls

docker container ls -a

When you stop a container, it is not automatically removed unless you started it with the --rm flag

To remove all stopped Containers:
docker container prune

By default, all stopped containers are removed. You can limit the scope using the --filter flag. For instance, the following command only removes stopped containers older than 24 hours:
docker container prune --filter "until=24h"

cleans up dangling images:
docker image prune
